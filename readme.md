# tictactoe

This game is a self directed project I undertook while studying JS with General Assembly. An early exercise to write psuedo code to establish whether or not a game of tic tac toe had been won prompted me to attempt to code the whole game. I have revisited it since finishing the course to tidy up and refactor code and add functionality.

### What it does
- Allows play against a computer opponent.
- Has a bit of basic logic built in to help the computer opponent determine a move.
- Has a random move generator fallback for the computer opponent.
- Looks good.

### What it doesn't do
- Allow you to select between x's and o's. This would be easy to add though. I have coded it so that they are not inherently linked to either player.
- Allow select or randomise who goes first. Again, this wouldn't be too difficult to add and I may in the future.
- Allow two player games. Two player games would actually have been easier to code. I wanted a JS challenge so chose to have a computer opponent.
